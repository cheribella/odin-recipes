    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Taho is a type of snack in the Philippines. It has a pudding-like texture. The toppings include a sweet brown
        syrup called arnibal, and sago pearls. You will often see hawkers early in the morning selling taho on the
        streets. The tofu contains essential amino acids, and a good source of calcium and iron.
