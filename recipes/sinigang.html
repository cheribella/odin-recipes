    <h1>Pork Sinigang</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins
        and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the
        other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as
        well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating
        each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through.
        Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of
        its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other
        regions in the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in
        love with
